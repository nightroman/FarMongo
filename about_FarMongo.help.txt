LONG DESCRIPTION
    **WARNING**: With this module tools you can change and delete databases,
    collections, documents, and data. Use it on your own risk and be careful.

    Requires:
    - Far Manager, FarNet, PowerShellFar
    - MongoDB server http://www.mongodb.org/
    - Mdbc module https://github.com/nightroman/Mdbc

    Optional:

    FarMongo provides the following commands:

        Open-MongoPanel
        Edit-MongoJsonLine

Open-MongoPanel
    This command opens Far Manager panels for browsing MongoDB data.
    Views and aggregation pipelines are supported.
    Panels and features:

        Documents: view, edit, create, delete documents
        Databases: view, delete databases, open collection panels
        Collections: view, rename, delete collections, open document panels

    Import the module and get help about parameters and features:

        Import-Module FarMongo
        help Open-MongoPanel -full

Edit-MongoJsonLine
    This command helps to edit JSON strings with escaped characters, for
    example multiline strings, when JSON is opened in the editor. See

        help Edit-MongoJsonLine

    In FarMongo JSON editors opened from panels by [F4] or [F7] this command
    may be invoked by pressing [F4] at the line to be edited.

    The command may be used in other JSON editors but it should be invoked
    manually, for example from the PowerShellFar command box or using a macro.

BSON/JSON FILES
    With optional BsonFile module, you can browse and edit BSON/JSON files:

        Open-MongoPanel -BsonFile ...\MyData.bson

    If you change data then on closing you are prompted to export data.
    Alternatively, use the menu [F1] \ "Export data to file", any time.

    See BsonFile documentation for some details about its work.
